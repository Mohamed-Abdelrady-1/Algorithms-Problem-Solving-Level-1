# C++ Algorithms & Problem Solving - Level 1 

This repository documents my journey in mastering C++ fundamentals and algorithm building. It contains practical solutions to algorithmic problems, organized by difficulty and concepts.

> **Current Status:** Set 1 (Basics & Structures) is uploaded. More sets are coming soon! ⏳

## 📂 Repository Structure

| Set | Folder Name | Problems | Focus Topics |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **01** | [**01_Basics_and_Structures**](./01_Basics_and_Structures) | 01 - 10 | Basic I/O, Structs, Enums, Arrays (Intro) |
| **02** | *Coming Soon...* | 11 - 20 | Loops & Advanced Validation |
| **03** | *Coming Soon...* | 21 - 30 | Functions & Modular Programming |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Concepts
- **Language:** C++
- **Key Concepts Applied in Set 1:**
  - `struct` for organizing data (e.g., User Info, Drivers).
  - `enum` for code readability (e.g., Pass/Fail, Odd/Even).
  - `arrays` & `do-while` loops.
  - writing **Clean Code** and Separate Functions.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Enter the folder of the specific set (e.g., `01_Basics_and_Structures`).
2. Open any `.cpp` file in your IDE (Visual Studio / VS Code).
3. Build and Run the file.
